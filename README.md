ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakob-rzeppa. Iâ€™m primarily interested in backend development with express.js, but also frontend development with react and Next.js.

# What I currently work on

- Currently IÂ´m developing a backend for a supply management system (more infos at https://github.com/jakob-rzeppa/supply-manager-backend).
- In the future I will build a Project to manage song lyrics and the matching chords for the guitar. I want to create this project to save all the song lyics in one place and directly transpose the chords (can make it easier to play certain songs by changing the chords) online (right now I have to use multiple websites / tools to play guitar).
